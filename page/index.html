	      <h2>The Insight Program</h2>
	      <p>
		Insight is a fellowship program, designed to help transition people
		out of academia and into industry. The program runs across 12 weeks,
		during which fellows design a project, and create a minimum viable product.
		This isn't designed to be a final polished product ready to present to a
		customer, but something that demonstrates a proof of concept and the
		skills of the fellows.

              <p>
		My project was What2Lego, a Lego project recommender. The concept was
		simple - upload a photo of some Legos to the web app, and it will locate
		the legos in the images, identify them, and suggest a set out of a catalog
		to build with them. While easily described, each step presented it's own challenge.
              </p>
